# bth-compiler-design
 
**Overview**

This project focuses on creating a basic Java compiler using C++. The compiler will parse, analyze, and generate executable bytecode for simple Java programs. The aim is to understand compiler construction principles by building a lightweight implementation.

**Features**

Lexical Analysis: Tokenizes Java source code.

Syntax Analysis: Builds an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) from the tokens.

Semantic Analysis: Validates variable declarations, types, and scopes.

Error Handling: Reports syntax and semantic errors.

**Dependencies:**

Flex (for lexical analysis)

Bison (for syntax analysis)

Java Runtime Environment (JRE): To test the generated bytecode.

Make (Optional): For building the project using a Makefile.
